The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest method of encryption.
The method is named after Julius Caesar who used it to communicate with his officials.
Itâ€™s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.
To cipher a given text we need an integer value, known as shift which indicates the number of position each letter of the text has been moved down.
Examples :
Text : ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Shift: 23
Cipher: XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW
Text : ATTACK AT ONCE
Shift: 4
Cipher: EXXEGO EX SRGI
Write a function "ceasarEncrypt" to receive a piece of plain text and an integer shift, and return the encrypted text, and a function "ceasarDecrypt" to receive a piece of encrypted text and an integer shift, and return the original text.
